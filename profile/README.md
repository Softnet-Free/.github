# Softnet Free
Softnet Free is an IoT communication platform for devices with embedded TCP/IP stack. It provides devices with a software-defined networking environment. Softnet makes the TCP and UDP protocols available for use in dynamic IP environments. The platform offers Remote Procedure Calls and Application Events as additional IPC mechanisms. The latter is used in event-driven interaction scenarios. The Softnet mechanism of Access Control can be used to implement different levels of access to devices, and a mechanism called Service Status Detection provides clients with information about the connectivity status of remote devices. Softnet also provides a convenient solution for managing devices, clients and user permissions, as well as managing shared access to devices with other persons/organizations. The latter allows owners to establish user-to-user or business-to-customer relationships. Using Softnet, developers can focus on IoT application logic without concerning about networking issues.  

Softnet Free is licensed under GNU GPL v3 or any later version. You can use, modify and distribute the server software and endpoint libraries without any restrictions. We’ll be glad if you participate in the further development and improvement of the project.

As of June 2023, the [Softnet endpoint library](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/softnet-java/) is available in Java SE 1.7. It works on Linux platforms, Raspbian, Android 5.0 and later versions. The client libraries for other platforms are under development. First of all, we focus on widely used 32-bit microcontrollers (STM32, PIC32, etc.) from leading manufactories such as STMicroelectronics, Microchip Technology, NXP, Texas Instruments, Infineon, etc.  

If you want to know more about the Softnet platform, the following sources will be helpful:

* [Softnet Programming Model (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/softnet-java/) / This guide describes the process of developing IoT applications using Softnet Java Library;
* [The Developer Guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/asn1codec-java/) / This guide provides the specification for the API of Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java). As an option, Softnet allows you to use the ASN.1 DER format to transfer data over a network, although you can use any other format, such as JSON;
