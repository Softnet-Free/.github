# Softnet Free
Softnet Free is an IoT communication platform for autonomous devices with embedded TCP/IP stack. It provides devices with a software-defined networking environment. Softnet makes the TCP and UDP protocols available for use in dynamic IP environments. As additional IPC mechanisms, Softnet offers Remote Procedure Calls and Application Events. The latter is used in event-driven interaction scenarios. The Softnet mechanism of Access Control can be used to implement different levels of access to devices. And a mechanism called Service Status Detection provides clients with information about the operational status of remote devices. Finally, Softnet provides a convenient solution for managing IoT projects, services, clients, users, permissions, contacts, and device sharing with other people/organizations. The latter allows owners to establish user-to-user or business-to-customer relationships. Using Softnet, developers can focus on IoT application logic without concerning about networking issues.  

Softnet Free is licensed under GNU GPL v3 or any later version. You can use, modify and distribute the server software and client libraries without any restrictions. We’ll be glad if you participate in the further development and improvement of the project.

As of June 2023, the [Softnet client library](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/softnet-java/) is available in Java SE 1.7. It works on Linux platforms, Raspbian, Android 5.0 and later versions. The client libraries for other platforms are under development. We are mainly targeting widespread 32bit microcontrollers (STM32, PIC32, etc.) from leading manufactories such as STMicroelectronics, Microchip Technology, NXP, Texas Instruments, Infineon, etc.  

If you want to know more about the Softnet platform, the following sources will be helpful:

* [Softnet Programming Model (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/softnet-java/) / This guide describes the process of developing IoT applications using Softnet Java Library;
* [The Developer Guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/asn1codec-java/) / This guide provides the specification for the API of Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java). As an option, Softnet allows you to use the ASN.1 DER format to transfer data over a network, although you can use any other format, such as JSON;
